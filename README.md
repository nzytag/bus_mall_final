Puget Sound Transit developed an app to keep track of what people like the most while riding the bus.

The front page is designed to show a random picture after each click to keep tally of the images that people like the most.

After opening the website you will see the header welcoming to the site.

Look at each image and click in the one that appeals you the most.
Riding the bus + funny pictures = easy commute!
