Assignment is to build a webapp for Puget Sound users. This app will have to display:  
1. Header with the name of the app
2. We need to display 3 images
* The images can be display in a variable in order to loop around them and display them randomly in the front.
* Images need to be able to show and not repeat in the front
3. We need to be able to keep track of the clicks on each and keep counting

Dev side:
I built a front end page containing the name of the site and the images.

My website works now. It displays random images and keeps a tally of the clicks on each image.

Next step would be display the results of the most clicked image after a round of (insert number here) clicks.
